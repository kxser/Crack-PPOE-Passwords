## Instructions
Here are the instructions on cracking "WAN" or PPOE passwords. There are a lot of reasons as to why someone would want to do so. Your ISP could be blocking you from switching modems and refusing to give you the credentials, you could' ve received and forgot them somewhere. Your wireless modem needs to have already been connected once to your ISP's Box / Fiber/Ethernet Converter.
#### Step 1

Install Virtualbox and and open in the image file in Virtualbox.

#### Step 2

After doing step one, open the settings of the image and select your Ethernet driver from the network settings (Make sure it's NOT your wifi driver.)

#### Step 3

Then, turn off your modem and plug one end of an ethernet cable into it's WAN port and plug the other end into your PC's LAN port.

#### Step 4

Run the virtual image and turn on the modem after. The credentials should be auto-sent by your modem on boot and you should easily be able to see the username and password. It will say that the login is incorrect, that's not important.
